## ðŸš€&nbsp;Installation

It it easiest to download the binary from the [latest release](https://github.com/eikendev/hackenv/releases).
Alternatively, install the [required dependencies](#dependencies) and build it yourself:
```bash
go get -u github.com/eikendev/hackenv/cmd/...
```

## ðŸ¤˜&nbsp;Features

- Download the latest official live image.
- Start an **SSH** daemon on the guest.
- Configure instant SSH access based on **public-key authentication**.
- Set up a **shared directory** between host and guest.
- Set the same **keyboard layout** in the guest as on the host.

## ðŸ“„&nbsp;Usage

First, make sure you have the [required dependencies](#dependencies) installed.
Also, you will need to [setup a bridge interface](https://jamielinux.com/docs/libvirt-networking-handbook/bridged-network.html); see below for how to do that with [virsh](https://www.libvirt.org/manpages/virsh.html).
hackenv will expect this interface to named `virbr0`, but you can adjust this using the command options.

Then, download an image using `hackenv get`.
This will download a live image from the official mirrors.
The download can take a while, so sit back and enjoy some tea.

By default, hackenv will operate with Kali Linux, and download its image.
If you want to work with Parrot Security instead, specify `hackenv --type=parrot`.

Next, run `hackenv up` to boot the virtual machine.
Once this command is finished, the VM is running and fully configured.

You can now start an SSH session with `hackenv ssh` or spin up a GUI with `hackenv gui`.

### File Sharing

hackenv will automatically set up a shared directory between the host and the virtual machine.
On the host side the directory is `~/.local/share/hackenv/shared`, while on the guest side it is located at `/shared`.

If SELinux denies access to the shared directory, you have to adjust the context of the directory.
You can run `./bin/hackenv_fixlabels` if you are on Fedora or similar.
Be sure to re-adjust the permissions if you add files externally.

### Creating a Bridge Interface

hackenv uses a bridge so that you can reach the guest from the host, while the guest can access the Internet.
We can create this bridge with virsh.
To do so, we first create an XML file that defines a virsh network.
Paste the the following content into a file named `default.xml`:

```xml
<network>
	<name>default</name>
	<bridge name="virbr0"/>
	<forward/>
	<ip address="192.168.122.1" netmask="255.255.255.0">
		<dhcp>
			<range start="192.168.122.2" end="192.168.122.254"/>
		</dhcp>
	</ip>
</network>
```

In this example, the bridge will operate in the network range `192.168.122.0/24`; please adapt this to your needs.
hackenv will expect the interface to have the name `virbr0` by default, but this can be changed using flags.

Now, run [the following commands](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52814732) to create the bridge:

```bash
sudo virsh net-define default.xml # Define the network.
sudo virsh net-start default # Start the network.
sudo virsh net-autostart default # Automatically start the network on boot.
sudo virsh net-list --all # Verify that the network was created.
```

Note that virsh needs to run **with privileges** so it can create an interface.

## âš™&nbsp;Configuration

The tool currently does not support configuration via files.
However, some options can be set using environment variables.
Check out the help (`--help`) of a command to see what options support this.

For instance, to operate with Parrot Security by default, you can set `$HACKENV_TYPE=parrot`.
If you work with both operating systems, then I recommend using shell aliases:
```bash
alias kali='hackenv --type=kali'
alias parrot='hackenv --type=parrot'
```

## ðŸ¥™&nbsp;Dependencies

- [libvirt](https://libvirt.org/)
- [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/)
- [virt-viewer](https://virt-manager.org/)

To build the binary yourself, you also need the development files of libvirt, usually called `libvirt-dev` or `libvirt-devel`.

## ðŸ’¡&nbsp;Alternatives

If you do not like this tool, the following options are worth checking out:
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) in combination with [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/)
