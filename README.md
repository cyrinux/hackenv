## ðŸš€&nbsp;Installation

It it easiest to download the binary from the [latest release](https://github.com/eikendev/hackenv/releases).
Alternatively, install the [required dependencies](#dependencies) and build it yourself:
```bash
go get -u github.com/eikendev/hackenv/cmd/...
```

## ðŸ¤˜&nbsp;Features

- Download the latest official live image.
- Works with Kali Linux and Parrot Security.
- **Simple and intuitive** command line interface.
- Configure instant SSH access based on **public-key authentication**.
- Set up a **shared directory** between host and guest.
- Set the same **keyboard layout** in the guest as on the host.

## ðŸ“„&nbsp;Usage

First, make sure you have the [required dependencies](#dependencies) installed.
Also, you will need a bridge interface [as described below](#creating-a-bridge-interface).
This can be as simple as running `./bin/hackenv_createbridge`.

Then, download an image using `hackenv get`.
This will download a live image from the official mirrors.
The download can take a while, so sit back and enjoy some tea.

Next, run `hackenv up` to boot the virtual machine.
Once this command is finished, the VM is running and fully configured.

You can now start an SSH session with `hackenv ssh` or spin up a GUI with `hackenv gui`.

Note that by default, hackenv will operate with Kali Linux, and respectively download its image.
If you want to operate with Parrot Security instead, specify `hackenv --type=parrot`, or check out [the configuration](#configuration).

### File Sharing

hackenv will automatically set up a shared directory between the host and the virtual machine.
On the host side the directory is `~/.local/share/hackenv/shared`, while on the guest side it is located at `/shared`.

If SELinux denies access to the shared directory, you have to adjust the context of the directory.
You can run `./bin/hackenv_fixlabels` if you are on Fedora or similar.
Be sure to re-adjust the permissions if you add files externally.

### Creating a Bridge Interface

hackenv uses a bridge so that you can reach the guest from the host for SSH, while the guest can access the Internet.
You can create this bridge by running `./bin/hackenv_createbridge`.
Note that this script **will request privileges** so it can create an interface.

Of course, please adapt the script to your specific needs.
The interface is expected to have the name `virbr0` by default, but this can be changed using command line flags.

## âš™&nbsp;Configuration

The tool currently does not support configuration via files.
However, some options can be set using environment variables.
Check out the help (`--help`) of a command to see what options support this.

For instance, to operate with Parrot Security by default, you can set `$HACKENV_TYPE=parrot`.
If you work with both operating systems, then I recommend using shell aliases:
```bash
alias kali='hackenv --type=kali'
alias parrot='hackenv --type=parrot'
```

## ðŸ¥™&nbsp;Dependencies

- [libvirt](https://libvirt.org/) (virsh)
- [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/) (ssh and ssh-keygen)
- setxkbmap
- [virt-viewer](https://virt-manager.org/)

To build the binary yourself, you also need the development files of libvirt, usually called `libvirt-dev` or `libvirt-devel`.

## ðŸ’¡&nbsp;Alternatives

If you do not like this tool, the following options are worth checking out:
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) in combination with [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/)
